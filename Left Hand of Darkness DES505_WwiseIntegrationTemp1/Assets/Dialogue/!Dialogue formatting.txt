DIALOGUE README

Formatting:

Every line should start with its own line number and end with the number of the next line in its sequence.  The last line in a sequence should have a '#' in place of its ending number.  For example:
1 This is line one. 2
2 This is line two. 3
3 This is line three. #

If a line is to be said by the player, preface it with a 'P'.  For example:
1P I am the player character. 2

If a line is to be said by the NPC, preface it with an 'N'.  For example:
1N I am an NPC. 2

If a line is to be one of multiple choices, preface it with a 'C'.  For example:
1C+ This choice will increase shifgrethor. 2
1C= This choice will not affect shifgrethor. 3
1C- This choice will decrease shifgrethor. 4
DO NOT create an option to choose "Goodbye."  This will be automatically prompted alongside every choice.
DO NOT give more than three options.  The maximum number of options that can be displayed is four, and the last one will always automatically be "Goodbye."

If a choice should prompt trade, make sure it includes the word "trade."  This is not case-sensitive.  For example:
1C+ This choice will increase shifgrethor. 2
1C- This choice will decrease shifgrethor. 3
1C= This choice will not affect shifgrethor but will open the trade screen. #

Create a single farewell from the NPC at the end of every tree.  This will be the NPC's reply whenever the player chooses to abort conversation.  For example:
36N Goodbye, player. #
24N See you soon! #
15N Farewell. #
